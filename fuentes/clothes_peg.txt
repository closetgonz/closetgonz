This font was discovered on the window of a laundromat in Melbourne, Australia (see clothes_peg.jpg.) I've attempted to use the style of the original artist. This is a free font, use however your mind sees fit. I'd like to know where and how you used it. If you pass this font along, please keep the three clothes_peg.* files together.
